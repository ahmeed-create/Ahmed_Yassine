# Arduino Projects

This folder contains a collection of microcontroller-based projects developed using the Arduino platform. Each project demonstrates core skills in electronics, programming, and hardware integration. These works reflect hands-on experimentation with sensors, actuators, and logic control systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

This directory includes:

- **Traffic Light:**  
  A programmable traffic signal simulation using LEDs and timed control loops.

- **Red Light with Motion Detector:**  
  A red alert system that activates when motion is detected, using a PIR sensor.

- **Ultrasonic Measure with LCD:**  
  A distance measuring system that displays real-time readings on an LCD screen using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04).

- **Radar with Ultrasonic Sensor:**  
  A 180Â° radar simulation with real-time visualization, using a servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor to scan surroundings.

- **Cours:**  
  Class-related Arduino code and mini-projects developed during coursework or labs.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** C/C++ (Arduino)
- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno/Nano, PIR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), LCD1602, Servo motors, LEDs
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Fritzing (for circuit design), Serial Monitor for debugging

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this folder is to:

- Document microcontroller experiments and project iterations,
- Explore real-world applications of basic sensor integration,
- Serve as a resource for prototyping and embedded systems practice.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Add schematics and wiring diagrams using Fritzing,
- Implement more advanced control logic (PID, state machines),
- Migrate key projects to more modular, object-oriented Arduino libraries.
