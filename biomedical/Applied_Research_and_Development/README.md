# Biodegradable Capsule for Blood-Brain Barrier Drug Delivery – MCG2542 Project

This repository contains the research, conceptual design, and documentation of a biomedical engineering project aimed at developing a biodegradable porous ceramic capsule for drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

## 📄 Project Overview

The main objective is to create a biocompatible and biodegradable capsule capable of safely transporting medication across the BBB, ensuring controlled release, MRI visibility, and minimal side effects.

## 🚧 Project Status

⚠️ **Note:** This is a research and design project only. No physical prototype has been built yet. All analyses and proposals are documented in the attached report.

## 🔬 Methodology & Approach

- **Biomedical context:** Detailed study of the BBB, current challenges, and medical needs.
- **Material selection:** Evaluation of porous ceramics for safety, degradability, and MRI tracking.
- **Design:** Considerations of diffusion rates, structural strength, and clinical feasibility.
- **Simulation:** Estimation of drug diffusion and capsule degradation rates.
