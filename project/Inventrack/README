# 📦 Inventrack – Inventory Management System

This repository contains the full documentation, hardware/software setup, and a functional demonstration of **Inventrack**, an RFID-based inventory management system developed for a university project.

## 📝 Project Overview

**Inventrack** is designed to automate and streamline inventory processes using RFID tags and Arduino microcontrollers. The system allows real-time monitoring of item check-ins and check-outs, improving traceability, reducing manual errors, and enhancing operational efficiency.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

- **Hardware:**
  - Arduino UNO
  - RFID Reader Module (RC522)
  - RFID Tags & Keycards
  - LEDs, Buzzer (for feedback)
  - Serial communication to PC

- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE (C/C++ for embedded code)
  - **PLX-DAQ (Excel Plugin):** For real-time data logging and monitoring
  - Microsoft Excel for data visualization and storage

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user scans an RFID tag using the reader connected to Arduino.
2. The RFID UID (unique ID) is transmitted via serial to the computer.
3. PLX-DAQ captures and logs the data directly into an Excel sheet with:
   - Date
   - Time
   - RFID UID
   - Additional columns for extended data

4. Real-time feedback is provided via LEDs and a buzzer for scan confirmation.
