# Pennsylvania Truss Bridge Design and Analysis â€“ CVG2540 Project

This repository contains the full documentation, analysis, and design process of a **Pennsylvania truss bridge** carried out as part of the *CVG2540 â€“ Mechanics of Materials* course at the University of Ottawa (Winter 2025).

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design, analyze, and physically build a truss bridge capable of withstanding significant loads while ensuring **stability, strength, and material optimization**. After comparing two common truss types â€“ **Pratt** and **Pennsylvania** â€“ we selected the Pennsylvania truss for its superior load-bearing capacity and enhanced rigidity.

## ðŸ”§ Methodology

- **Manual analysis:** Static equilibrium and joint method to calculate internal forces and stability (SI formula).
- **Numerical modeling:** Using SAP2000 to simulate and validate the bridge under applied loads.
- **Design optimization:** Cross-section analysis (using Euler buckling and maximum stress criteria) to ensure all members are safe under critical loading.

## ðŸ›  Construction

We built the bridge using **balsa wood sticks**, carefully assembled and optimized according to the calculated results. The final bridge achieved a load-to-self-weight ratio of ~234x, successfully resisting a load of 460 N with a weight of only 200 g.
