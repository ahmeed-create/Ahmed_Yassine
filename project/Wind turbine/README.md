# Wind Turbine Nacelle Design – MCG2501 Project

This repository contains the complete documentation and engineering work for our wind turbine nacelle design project. The report is written in French.

## 📄 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design a fully mechanical, reliable, and durable nacelle for a small horizontal-axis domestic wind turbine. The design was developed to meet the client's requirements (Éole) and adapted for Ontario’s weather conditions.

We focused on optimizing energy efficiency, mechanical robustness, and ease of assembly and maintenance, using locally available materials wherever possible.

## 🔧 Key Systems

- **Speed Regulation System (CVT):**
  A fully mechanical continuously variable transmission system to adapt rotor speed to generator requirements smoothly and efficiently.

- **Braking System:**
  A fail-safe disk braking system activated by a tachogenerator and driven by a DC motor with worm gear to ensure overspeed protection.

- **Generator:**
  A 50 kW permanent magnet generator selected for high efficiency, low maintenance, and compatibility with low-speed wind operation.

- **Rotation System:**
  A nacelle yaw control system using a ring gear and multiple pinions to keep the turbine facing the wind.

- **Battery:**
  A PylonTech US2000C LiFePO4 battery for energy storage and safety backup.

## 🛠️ Other Mechanical Elements

- Bearings, shafts, rigid couplings, circlips, splines, and keys have been integrated to ensure smooth transmission and durability.
- Materials were selected to optimize strength, weight, and environmental resistance (e.g., fiberglass composite nacelle body, steel shafts).

## 📷 Visuals

CAD models and technical drawings are included in the PDF report to illustrate the entire design, subsystems, and key components.

## 📁 Files

- **Rapport_MCG2501_French_Version.pdf**: The full report (in French) detailing the design, engineering calculations, CAD models, and assembly drawings.
- **(Optional)** wind turbine (1) word.docx: A brief overview (mostly redundant with the main report).
